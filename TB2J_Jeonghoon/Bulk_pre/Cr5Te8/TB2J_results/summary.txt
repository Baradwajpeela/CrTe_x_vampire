The spin ground state is estimated by calculating
 the eigenvalues and eigen vectors of J(q):

The energy minimum is at the q-point:[0.5 0.  0. ]
The eigenstate at the energy minimum is:
 > Cr1: (-0.008, -0.002, -1.000)
 > Cr2: (0.602, -0.495, 0.627)
 > Cr3: (-0.023, 0.219, -0.976)
 > Cr4: (0.094, -0.058, -0.994)
 > Cr5: (0.013, -0.010, 1.000)
